## CVE-2025-11279: RCE via CSV Injection in Axosoft

**Discovered by:** Nakul Singh  
**Date reported:** September 20, 2025  
**CVE ID assigned:** CVE-2025-11279  
**Vendor:** Axosoft

### Summary

Axosoft contains a CSV injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to perform remote code execution. A low-privileged attacker can create a new work item and inject a malicious payload into the title field.

When an administrator accesses the work items list, exports the data to a CSV file, and opens it in a spreadsheet application, the payload executes, granting the attacker a reverse shell on the administratorâ€™s machine.

### Technical Details

*(See the vulnerability report in reports folder of my-cves repository.)*

### Impact

The impact of this CSV injection vulnerability is severe. An attacker can exploit it to execute arbitrary code, compromise sensitive data, or manipulate application behavior. When the infected CSV file is opened in spreadsheet software, malicious commands are triggered, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or other malicious activities. This poses a significant risk to the security and integrity of the affected system.

### Mitigation

To prevent CSV injection vulnerabilities, proper input validation and sanitization are essential. Developers should ensure user input conforms to expected formats and does not include malicious content. Special characters with special meanings in CSV files (such as equals sign `=`, plus sign `+`, etc.) should be properly escaped or sanitized before being included in CSV output.
